# Bamba-WebService
A web service for creating recipes and shoppinglists.

This web service was created for a course in mobile applications and represents the back-end to the Android 
application with the same name.

The idea was to get rid of the time that I (and many others) spend on making shopping lists every week and 
to instead simply select the dinners that you would like to eat and have the application generate a 
shopping list. 

When presenting this lab I installed this web service on a Raspberry Pi with a MySQL server.
